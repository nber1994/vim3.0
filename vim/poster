Vim - Vi IMproved. A clone of the UNIX text editor Vi. Very useful for 
editing programs and other plain ASCII text. Full Vi compatibility (except Q 
command, you don't need it). Includes most Ex commands.

Extra features above Vi: Multilevel undo, command line history, improved 
command line editing, command typeahead display, command to display yank 
buffers, possibility to edit binary files, line wrapping can be switched off,
file name stack, can be adjusted to understand error messages from any
compiler, shows current file name in window title, on-line help, etc. 

Version 2.0, update to 1.27. Most important changes:
- 'wrap' option to switch line wrapping on/off
- filename completion is more like other programs and adjustable
- automatic detection of CR/LF line separator
- '-b' command line option to make editing binary files more easy
- added abbreviation
- :make command for quickly jumping to errors
- MSDOS version uses bios calls for screen output, ansi.sys not needed
- many small changes to make Vim more vi-compatible

Portability: Runs on MSDOS, Amiga and several UNIX versions.

Distribution:
comp.binaries.ibm.pc:	vim_dos.zip:	MSDOS binary and documentation

comp.binaries.amiga:	vim_bin.lha:	Amiga binary and documentation

comp.sources.misc:	shell archive with sources and documentation

The documentation is almost the same for all systems. For MSDOS CR-LF is used
for line separator. For Amiga .info files are included. For the shell archive
some files are uuencoded because of unprintable characters.

Vim is charityware. Read uganda.txt for details.
