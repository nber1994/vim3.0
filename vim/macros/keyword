" Some handy keyword-completion macros.
" The word in front of the cursor is taken as a search string, the previous
" partially matching word is found which then replaces the word in front
" of the cursor. The macros work in insert mode.
"
" ^K searches backward for the first match
" ^N searches backward for the next match (after ^K)
" ^P searches forward for the previous match (after ^K)
"
" Thanks to Dave Caughey.
