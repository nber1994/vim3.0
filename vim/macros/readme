The macros in the maze, hanoi and urm directories can be used to test Vim for
vi compatibility. They have been written for vi to show its unlimited
possibilities.

HANOI are macros that solve the tower of hanoi problem.
MAZE  are macros that solve a maze (amazing!).
URM   are macros that simulate a simple computer: "Universal Register Machine"

They are unmodified.


The other files contain some handy utilities:

center: macros to center current line in 80-character line
keyword: keyword completion macros
