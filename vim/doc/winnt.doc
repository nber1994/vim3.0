The Windows NT port of Vim has not been tested very much. Be prepared to run
into some problems in the NT specific parts.

Known problems:

Display is not always correct. Type CTRL-L to fix this.

CTRL-C in a child shell (created with ":sh" or CTRL-Z) kills Vim. Hopefully
the recovery mechanism will get your file back, but don't rely on this.
