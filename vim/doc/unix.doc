This file contains the particularities for the UNIX version of Vim.

The default help filename is "/usr/local/lib/vim.hlp"
The files "$HOME/.vimrc" and "$HOME/.exrc" are used instead of "s:.vimrc" and 
"s:.exrc". Additionally "/usr/local/etc/vimrc" is used first.

Temporary files (for filtering) are put in "/tmp".

With wildcard expansion you can use <~> (home directory) and <$> 
(environment variable).

Because terminal updating under UNIX is often slow (e.g. serial line 
terminal, shell window in suntools), the 'showcommand' and 'ruler' options 
are default off. If you have a fast terminal, try setting them.

The file Vim132 is a shell script that can be used to put Vim in 132 column 
mode on a vt100 and lookalikes.

The *.info files are for the Amiga. You don't need them with unix.
