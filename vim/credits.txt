Credits for Vim - Vi Improved

Most of Vim was written by Bram Moolenaar.

Parts of reference.doc come from several Vi manuals, written by:
	W.N. Joy
	Alan P.W. Hewett
	Mark Horton

The editor Vim is based on Stevie and includes (ideas from) other software,
worked on by:
	Tim Thompson		Stevie
	Tony Andrews		Stevie
	G. R. (Fred) Walter	Stevie
	Henry Spencer		regular expressions
	Steve Kirkendall	Elvis
	Juergen Weigert		Lattice version, AUX improvements, UNIX and 
				MSDOS ports
	Robert Webb		Command line completion and other patches
	Olaf Seibert		DICE version and regexp improvements
	Peter da Silva		termlib
	Chris & John Downey     xvi (ideas for multi windows version)
        Loic Grenie             xvim (ideas for multi windows version)
        Keith Bostic            nvi
	Berkeley DB(3)		ideas for swap file
	Ralf Brown		SPAWNO library for MSDOS

I must thank all the people that sent me bug reports and suggestions. The
list is too long to mention them all here. And mentioning only a few of them
would be an insult to the others, so I'll don't mention anybody. But Vim
would not be the same without the ideas from all these people. They keep Vim
alive!
